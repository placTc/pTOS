# pTOS
An attempt at an operating system?

This is a personal project whose main aim is to teach me how computer

If, for some reason you do want to run this, launch i368 QEMU using bootable.img as a floppy (-fda argument)

If you want to change the code and recompile it, use this NASM command
```
nasm -f bin -o bootable.img bootable.asm
```
